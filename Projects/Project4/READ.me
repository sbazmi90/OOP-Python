Problem Statement:

Create a system to keep track of different types of employees in a company, such as Managers and Workers. Both Managers and Workers will have a name, id, and salary, but Managers will also have a bonus attribute, while Workers will have an hourly_rate attribute. Both Managers and Workers should have a method called calculate_pay that returns the pay based on their salary, bonus, or hourly rate. Managers should also override the calculate_pay method to include their bonus in the calculation.
